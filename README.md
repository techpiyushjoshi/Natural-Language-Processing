## Discussed till now

- Skill vs Degree
    - Skill is very necessary but degree is necessary for entry.
- Non elite institutions
    - Skill is paramount
- Government vs Private Jobs
    - Competition is very high
    - Data Science - Government Jobs
    - Go for lateral entry in these sectors like SBI, including Insurance Companies like LIC, PSU
    - Salary will often get reduced, jobs security ni chiye
- Skills
    - Scala (rare skill)
    - 6 months in certain field makes you perfect
    - Animation may take 1 year
    - Cloud only one in AWS, GCP, Azure
    - Balance the pros and cons of any decision
- Online presence is necessity (Naukri.com, Indeed, Instagram, Linkedin, Angelist)
    - It will develop a sense of what’s needed or expected of u
    - Pick Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, make list you will get more exposure
    - Write article on Medium - Blogging, make Youtube videos
    - PoC (Proof of Concept), make projects
    - See the profile of people with similar experience
- Job Types
    - Data Scientist
    - Data Engineer
    - Data Analyst
    - Statistician
    - ML Engineer (Data Scientist can’t deploy model, this is a software engineer who knows ML)
    - NLP Engineer
    - Business Analyst: IT, Stock Firms (which shares you should buy, what thing you should invest like Crypto stuff)
